1. You should have an unordered list with the class `todo-list`.
2. Inside the unordered list, you should have four list items.
3. Inside each list item, there should be:

   - An `input` element with the type `checkbox` and `id` set to a unique value.
   - A `label` element with the `for` attribute set to the corresponding input element's `id`.
   - An unordered list with the class `sub-item`.
   - A list item with an anchor element in it. The anchor should have the class `sub-item-link`, a valid `href` value, and a `target` value that makes the link open in a new tab.

4. You should remove the default list style from your `.todo-list`.
5. Your anchor elements shouldn't have any default text decoration.
